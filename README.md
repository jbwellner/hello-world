# hello-world
first step into the wilderness of 1's and 0's
These are the first steps on a journey into better understanding the environment I live.  
This journey, and what I will learn, is vital to ensure understanding, clarity and enhancing my ability to thrive in a world that I must navigate on my own if necessary. 
Unsure of where it will take me and it will only get better with each step.
